It's not just what you're born with,

--

It's what you choose to bear.

--

It's not how big your share is,

--

but how much you can share.

--

Oh, it's not the fights you dream of,

--

But those you really fought.

--

It's not just what you're given,

--

But what you do with what you've got.

However, thinking through these mathematical conditions may not be helpful to develop intuitions about Simpson’s Paradox.\n\nLooking at a simple visualization may help us to develop some understanding of Simpson’s Paradox.\n\n# Visualization\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# What Do We See?\n\nEven when presented visually, it is difficult to think through Simpson's Paradox. \n\nWhat do we see? \n\n1. For the *sample overall*, the regression line slopes *downward*: more treatment appears to be associated with *less* of the *desirable outcome*.\n2. When we control for group--when we start to think in multivariate terms--the individual group regression lines slope *upward*: more treatment appears to be associated with *more* of the *desirable outcome*.\n3. Thus, a more complex *multivariate* analysis gives very different results: graphing outcomes only against treatment or intervention suggests that the treatment or intervention is *harmful*; graphing outcomes against treatment or intervention, but accounting for group membership, suggests that the treatment is *helpful*.\n4. The crucial understanding is points (1)-(3) above, but *why* might this be? The discrepancy results from the fact that treatment provision is *correlated* with the outcome. Those with lower levels of the desirable outcome are getting higher levels of the treatment or intervention, a common enough situation if we think about it. This leads to the seeming *paradox* of finding quite different results if we only think about *intervention* and *outcome*, versus if we think about *intervention*, *outcome*, and *group*. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

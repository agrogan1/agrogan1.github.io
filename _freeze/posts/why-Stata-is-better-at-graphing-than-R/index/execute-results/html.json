However, Stata's capabilities as a data visualization program are sometimes under-rated. The intent of the post is to show that Stata can often perform the same graphing task as R, with much simpler, and much more intuitive, command syntax.\n\nThis post uses simulated social service agency data clients. In each program, I am going to graph mental health of clients (at Time 2) by program.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Stata\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\nimport delimited \"clients.csv\", clear // import data\n\t\ngraph bar mental_health_t2, /// bar graph of mean outcome\nover(program) /// over program\nasyvars // bars that have color\n\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n![Bar Graph in Stata](mybarStata.png)\n\n# R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr) # library to import data\n\t\nclients <- read_csv(\"clients.csv\") # import data\n\t\nlibrary(ggplot2) # library for graphs\n\t\nggplot(clients, # the data that I am using\n       aes(x = program, # 'aesthetic' includes x\n           y = mental_health_T2, # and y\n           fill = program)) + # and fill by program\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, # summarizing y \n               geom = \"bar\") + # with bars\n  theme_minimal() # minimal theme\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",

Effect sizes are *one way* to think about these issues. Discussion about the *merits of*, and *calculation of* effect sizes is *energetic* and *complex*. However, one commonly accepted way of thinking about effect sizes is *Cohen's d*.\n\n# Cohen's d Calculator\n\nI have recently updated my calculator to calculate and visualize Cohen's d.

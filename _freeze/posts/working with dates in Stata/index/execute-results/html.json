We then make sure to format these numbers as dates.\n\n# Get The Data\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nfile /Users/agrogan/Desktop/GitHub/agrogan1.github.io/posts/working.do not for(601);\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# List And Describe The Data\n\nWe see that both date variables are formatted as strings\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRunning /Users/agrogan/Desktop/GitHub/agrogan1.github.io/posts/working with dates in Stata/pr> le.do ...\n\nfile /Users/agrogan/Desktop/GitHub/agrogan1.github.io/posts/working.do not found\nr(601);\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Create Date Variables\n\n> There are *many* date functions in Stata, to work with different kinds of data in different formats. `help date` should direct you to the documentation for *Date and time functions*.\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRunning /Users/agrogan/Desktop/GitHub/agrogan1.github.io/posts/working with dates in Stata/pr> le.do ...\n\nfile /Users/agrogan/Desktop/GitHub/agrogan1.github.io/posts/working.do not found\nr(601);\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> The command has created 2 dates in numeric form, but they display as numbers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRunning /Users/agrogan/Desktop/GitHub/agrogan1.github.io/posts/working with dates in Stata/pr> le.do ...\n\nfile /Users/agrogan/Desktop/GitHub/agrogan1.github.io/posts/working.do not found\nr(601);\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Format As Dates\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRunning /Users/agrogan/Desktop/GitHub/agrogan1.github.io/posts/working with dates in Stata/pr> le.do ...\n\nfile /Users/agrogan/Desktop/GitHub/agrogan1.github.io/posts/working.do not found\nr(601);\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Calculations\n\nWe can now use dates in calculations.

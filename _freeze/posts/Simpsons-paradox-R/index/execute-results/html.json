However, thinking through these mathematical conditions may not be helpful to develop intuitions about Simpson's Paradox.\n\nCareful inspection of visualizations can help us to develop some understanding of Simpson's Paradox.\n\n> The key substantive conclusion is that models of the data that only account for two variables may provide *very different*--or even *opposite*--conclusions from models of the world that account for many variables.\n\n# Some Hypothetical Data\n\nThese data are based on the hypothetical data provided by Simpson (1951).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n------------------------------------\n count   treatment   status   group \n------- ----------- -------- -------\n   4     untreated   alive      A   \n\n   3     untreated    dead      A   \n\n   8      treated    alive      A   \n\n   5      treated     dead      A   \n\n   2     untreated   alive      B   \n\n   3     untreated    dead      B   \n\n  12      treated    alive      B   \n\n  15      treated     dead      B   \n------------------------------------\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Sample As A Whole\n\n> The treatment appears to have NO effect.

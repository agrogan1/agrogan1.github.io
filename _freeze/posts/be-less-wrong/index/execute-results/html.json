Yet, at the same time we must recognize that our understandings are at best *iterative* and *contingent.* While we will never have a perfect understanding of social reality, we can always improve our understandings, and move in the direction of being *less wrong*.\n\nAs @Silverman1998 wrote: \n\n> \"... there is no way to know when our observations about complex events in nature are complete. Our knowledge is finite, Karl Popper emphasised, but our ignorance is infinite. ... [W]e can never be certain about the consequences of our interventions, we can only narrow the area of uncertainty. This admission is not as pessimistic as it sounds: claims that resist repeated energetic challenges often turn out to be quite reliable. Such 'working truths' are the building blocks for the reasonably solid structures that support our everyday actions...\" [@Silverman1998]\n\nThis recalls the famous saying by the statistician George Box about statistical models, reported in many places, and well captured in the passage below by @Hand2014:\n\n> \"In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the realityâ€”a point well made by George Box in his oft-cited remark that 'all models are wrong, but some are useful' (Box, 1979 in @MR0554183).\" [@Hand2014]\n\nA key task then, of using quantitative methods is to use them to try to be progressively *less wrong* about the answers we are finding to important questions about improving human wellbeing. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",

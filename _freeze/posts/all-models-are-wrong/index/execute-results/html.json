Yet, at the same time we must recognize that our understandings are at best *iterative* and *contingent.* While we will never have a perfect understanding of social reality, we can always improve our understandings, and move in the direction of being *less wrong*.\n\nAs @Silverman1998 wrote: \n\n> \"... there is no way to know when our observations about complex events in nature are complete. Our knowledge is finite, Karl Popper emphasised, but our ignorance is infinite. ... [W]e can never be certain about the consequences of our interventions, we can only narrow the area of uncertainty. This admission is not as pessimistic as it sounds: claims that resist repeated energetic challenges often turn out to be quite reliable. Such 'working truths' are the building blocks for the reasonably solid structures that support our everyday actions...\" [@Silverman1998]\n\nThis recalls the famous saying by the statistician George Box about statistical models, reported in many places, and well captured in the passage below by @Hand2014:\n\n> \"In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the realityâ€”a point well made by George Box in his oft-cited remark that 'all models are wrong, but some are useful' (Box, 1979 in @MR0554183).\" [@Hand2014]\n\nA key task then, of using advanced quantitative methods is to use them to try to be progressively *less wrong* about the answers we are finding to important questions about improving human wellbeing. \n\nThere are many potential complications in data analysis. \n\nOmitted variables are an issue that trouble all quantitative research. \n\n*Simpson's Paradox* [@Simpson1951] wherein omission of a relevant *covariate* (e.g. $z_{it}$ such as SES, community characteristics, country level characteristics) may also lead to dramatically incorrect results. The issue of omitted variables is a crucially important--and sometimes underappreciated--issue that pervades all statistical work.\n\nStatistically, we imagine a situation where the true model is:\n\n$$\\text{child outcome}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{parenting}_{it} +$$ \n\n$$\\beta_2 \\text{individual or family or community or country characteristic}_{it} + $$\n$$u_{0i} + e_{it}$$\n\nIf *individual or family or community or country characteristics* in fact influence *outcome*, but are not included in the statistical model, perhaps because they are not measured in the data, then the estimate of $\\beta_1$ for *parenting* will be biased. See @fig-Simpson for an illustration. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An Illustration of Simpson's Paradox](index_files/figure-html/fig-Simpson-1.png){#fig-Simpson width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen possible confounders are *measured*, we can include those variables in the statistical model. When possible confounders are *unmeasured*, we need to try to use methods that capture those *unmeasured* confounders.\n",

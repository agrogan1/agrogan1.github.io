My interests are in developing more knowledge to reduce violence against children and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), with the aim of improving child and family well-being. It is my hope that a better understanding of how to reduce violence against children, and how to reduce ACEs, will contribute to a better understanding of how to improve mental health and well-being across the lifespan. In this research I try to understand the family and community origins of aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety and depression across diverse communities and contexts. My current research focuses on parenting and child development using international data. I try to understand these issues within the context of current conversations about children’s rights.

A particular focus of my work has been to examine the outcomes of physical punishment. 

> "Corporal punishment is the most common form of violence against children worldwide, leading to the injury and death of thousands of children each year. Its very widespread social acceptance means that a level of violence in childrearing is normalised, entrenching children’s low status and paving the way for other forms of violence and mistreatment." [@CP10KeyMessages2022]

> "The magnitude of violence against children is staggering. Globally, the most pervasive form of violence against children is corporal punishment. Because it often occurs in the confines of homes and other settings where children live, study and play, it is largely hidden and challenging to detect. Worldwide, it is estimated that nearly one billion children are hit, slapped, spanked, pinched, or otherwise physically punished regularly by their parents, caregivers, teachers, or other trusted adults, the same individuals responsible for nurturing, protecting, and educating them [@UNICEF2017; @WHO2020]." [@StewartTufescu2023]

Working closely with many colleagues, we have shown that physical punishment is associated with a wide variety of negative outcomes [e.g. @Gershoff2016, [*learn more*](https://agrogan1.github.io/research.html#meta-analysis-of-research-on-corporal-punishment)]. Additional quantitative work has demonstrated that this finding remains true even in contexts when physical punishment is used minimally, or when used in ostensibly "normative" ways. In a number of papers, we have investigated these associations [across diverse communities and countries](research.qmd). Lastly, in additional papers, we have worked to demonstrate more "causally robust" associations between physical punishment and undesirable child outcomes using a variety of quantitative methods.

A more recent stream of research pays particular attention to parenting and child development [across low and middle income countries (LMIC's)](https://agrogan1.github.io/research.html#multiple-indicator-cluster-surveys-mics-unicef-data). Countries that are not high-income countries are under-represented in current social research [@Henrich2010], particularly research on parenting and child development [@Draper2022]. Further, in this new stream of research, we examine a broader range of parenting behaviors, with a particular emphasis on "positive parenting" strategies [e.g. @Ward2022LCA; @Ward2023]. From this research, the only positive discipline behavior that has emerged so far as being associated with better child outcomes is "explain[ing] why (child)’s behaviour was wrong." [@Ward2023]

I teach courses mostly in the area of statistics, quantitative methods and data visualization.

Our meta-analytic review of 50 years of research on the outcomes of physical punishment (Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor, 2016) has been part of several national level policy discussions on parenting.  In 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics passed a policy statement discouraging the use of physical punishment of children (Sege and Siegel, 2018). Our meta-analysis was cited in that policy statement. Referring to our work, the policy statement indicated that "A 2016 meta-analysis showed that current literature does not support the finding of benefit from physical punishment in the long-term."  Similarly, in early 2019, the American Psychological Association also passed a resolution discouraging the use of physical punishment (APA, 2019). This policy statement also  cited our meta-analysis.

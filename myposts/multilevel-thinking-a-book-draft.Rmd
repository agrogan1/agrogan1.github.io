I have been working on a project entitled [*Multilevel Thinking*](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/). In this document, I try to provide clear explanations of ideas that may be well known in the statistical literature, but not that often used in the applied, or advocacy based, research literature. I use cross-cultural research as an example, but the ideas are equally applicable whether applied to studying *children in schools*, *residents in neighborhoods*, or *individuals or families in countries*.

The document started out as a set of notes on *things I only get to discuss during breaks, or after class, or during office hours* in my class on *Multilevel and Longitudinal Modeling*, and has grown from that set of notes into a draft introduction to multilevel modeling:

I am hoping to find a publisher this year.

You can hear the lecture by [signing up for the course](https://ssw.umich.edu/offices/continuing-education/certificate-courses/political-social-work), but I have posted a link to the slides [on my main page](https://agrogan1.github.io/#data-visualization). Here is a [direct link](https://agrogan1.github.io/dataviz/political-social-work/#/).

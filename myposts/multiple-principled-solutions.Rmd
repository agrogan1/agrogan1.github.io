One of my most recent ideas about statistical workflows is that there are certainly wrong decisions that one can make with data. 

For example, I would not want to write the paper that says that smoking prevents lung cancer, nor would I want to write a paper saying spanking is good for children. 

That being said, I think there are often multiple principled ways forward.

Often the key is not so much to make the 100% correct decision, but to make one of several possible principled decisions. 

Then after making a principled decision, one is transparent about the decision that one made.

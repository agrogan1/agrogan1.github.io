I have updated my [visualization of country level bans on corporal punishment](https://agrogan1.github.io/research/cpbans/) to reflect the fact that [Georgia has become the 58th country to ban corporal punishment](https://endcorporalpunishment.org/georgia-prohibits-all-corporal-punishment-of-children/).

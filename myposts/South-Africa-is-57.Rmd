I have updated my [visualization of country level bans on corporal punishment](https://agrogan1.github.io/research/cpbans/) to reflect the fact that [South Africa has become the 57th country to ban corporal punishment](https://endcorporalpunishment.org/south-africa-prohibits-all-corporal-punishment/).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

```

There are many different kinds of data visualization. In the language of the `ggplot` package for R, there are many different kinds of `geom`etries that we can apply to data.

```{r, fig.cap="Multiple Geometries for Data Visualization", echo=FALSE, fig.height=1}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/banner.png")

```

However, after a number of years of working on data visualization, I have started to think about the advantages of bar graphs. While *not every visualization needs to be a bar graph*, it sometimes seems as though many data visualizations *would work well as a bar graph*.

In this slide deck, I use the `ggplot` package to develop bar graphs with `geom_col`, one of the bar graph `geom`etries. After building a basic bar graph, I apply many formatting ideas, most of which I have learned from the blog of Cedric Scherer ([https://www.cedricscherer.com/](https://www.cedricscherer.com/)).

I discuss these ideas [here](https://agrogan1.github.io/dataviz/should-everything-be-a-bar-graph/#1)

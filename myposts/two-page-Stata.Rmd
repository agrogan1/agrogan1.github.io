I've made major updates to *Two Page Stata*: [https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/two-page-stata/TwoPageStata.pdf](https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/two-page-stata/TwoPageStata.pdf).

There are many content updates and clarifications, but I have also rebuilt this document using the new [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) system.

*Two Page Stata* is intended to be an introduction to Stata in 2 pages. The treatment here is intended to be extremely brief, in order to create a kind of "cheat sheet" that can be presented in 2 pages.

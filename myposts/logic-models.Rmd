Logic models are used extensively in program development and program evaluation.

I am working on an evolving proof of concept of creating a logic model in graphviz. [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) is a programming language designed to represent graphs. 

The proof of concept can be found [here](https://agrogan1.github.io/teaching/logic-models/logic-models.html)

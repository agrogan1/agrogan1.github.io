# Introduction ðŸŒ²

There is sometimes a *debate*--shall we say--about whether Stata can make beautiful graphs, particularly in comparison to using `ggplot` in R. Below, I try to use as many of Stata's options as I can to make a beautiful graph. I'll admit at the outset that it is perhaps not as beautiful as the same graph would be in `ggplot`, but believe that it comes close.

# Data Source ðŸŒ²

The data used in this example are derived from the R package *Functions and Datasets for "Forest Analytics with R"*.

According to the documentation, the source of these data are: "von Guttenbergâ€™s Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) tree measurement data."

The documentation goes on to further note that:

> "The data are measures from 107 trees. The trees were selected as being of average size from healthy and well stocked stands in the Alps."

# Graph ðŸŒ²

Below please find the *admittedly complicated* graph command. Note, however, that the graph builds upon basic ideas that we want a twoway graph, with a scatterplot and a lowess smoother. Everything else is just an option.

I make extensive use of the `///` notation which allows me to spread the graph along multiple lines.

    twoway /// two way graph
    (scatter height age_base, /// scatterplot
	mcolor(dkgreen%25) msymbol(circle)) /// dark green transparent markers
    (lowess height age_base, lcolor(gold) lwidth(thick)), /// smoother; gold line
    scheme(lean2) /// better base scheme
    title("Tree Height by Tree Age") /// title
    xtitle("Tree Age") /// title for x axis
    ytitle("Tree Height") /// title for y axis
    caption("Gutten Tree Data") /// caption
    legend(order(1 "trees" 2 "smoother") position(6) rows(1)) // better labels and format for legend

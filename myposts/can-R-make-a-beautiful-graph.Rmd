# Introduction 

In another blog post, entitled ["Can Stata make a beautiful graph?"](./can-Stata-make-a-beautiful-graph.html), I tried to make a very beautiful / well designed graph in Stata. In that blog post I suggested that ggplot would likely make a much better graph with syntax that was about the same level of complication.

Below I put that idea to the test. I believe that the Stata graph compares favorably with the R/ggplot graph.

# Call The Libraries

```{r}

library(FAwR) # forestry analytics w/ R

library(ggplot2) # beautiful graphs

```

# Get The Data

```{r}

data(gutten) # gutten tree data

```

# Make The Graph

```{r, out.width="80%"}

ggplot(gutten, # the data I am using
       aes(x = age.base, # x is tree age
           y = height)) + # y is tree height
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", # dark green points
             alpha = .5, # transparency
             size = 2) + # point size
  geom_smooth(color = "gold") + # gold smoother
  labs(title = "Tree Height by Tree Age", # title
       x = "Tree Age", # x axis label
       y = "Tree Height") + # y axis label
  theme_minimal() # minimal theme

```

# Compare The Stata Graph

```{r, out.width="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("gutten.png") # load Stata graph

```

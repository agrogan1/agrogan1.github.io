# Introduction 

In another blog post, entitled ["Can Stata make a beautiful graph?"](./can-Stata-make-a-beautiful-graph.html), I tried to make a very beautiful / well designed graph in Stata. In that blog post I suggested that ggplot would likely make a much better graph with syntax that was about the same level of complication.

Below I put that idea to the test. I believe that the Stata graph compares favorably with the R/ggplot graph.

# Call The Libraries

```{r}

library(FAwR) # forestry analytics w/ R

library(ggplot2) # beautiful graphs

```

# Get The Data

```{r}

data(gutten) # gutten tree data

```

# Make The Graph

```{r, out.width="80%"}

ggplot(gutten,
       aes(x = age.base, 
           y = height)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen",
             alpha = .5,
             size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(color = "gold") + 
  labs(title = "Tree Height by Tree Age",
       x = "Tree Age",
       y = "Tree Height") +
  theme_minimal() 

```

# Compare The Stata Graph

```{r, out.width="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("gutten.png") # load Stata graph

```

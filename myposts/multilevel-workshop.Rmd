I have developed a set of workshop materials based upon my draft book on multilevel modeling. The book is entitled [*Multilevel Thinking*](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/). The book draft discusses multilevel modeling in the context of cross cultural, or international, research. 

The workshop materials are here: [https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-workshop/](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-workshop/)

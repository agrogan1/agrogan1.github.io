I have been working on a project entitled [*Multilevel Thinking*](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/). In this document, I try to provide clear explanations of ideas that may be well known in the statistical literature, but not that often used in the applied research literature. I use cross-cultural research as an example, but the ideas are equally applicable whether applied to studying *children in schools*, *residents in neighborhoods*, or *individuals or families in countries*:

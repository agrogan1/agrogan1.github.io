    "text": "Countries of the World\n\n\nMy interests are in developing more knowledge to reduce violence against children and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), with the aim of improving child and family well-being. It is my hope that a better understanding of how to reduce violence against children, and how to reduce ACEs, will contribute to a better understanding of how to improve mental health and well-being across the lifespan. In this research I try to understand the family and community origins of aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety and depression across different communities and contexts. My current research focuses on parenting and child development using international data. I try to understand these issues within the context of current conversations about children’s rights.\nA particular focus of my work has been to examine the outcomes of physical punishment.\n\n“Corporal punishment is the most common form of violence against children worldwide, leading to the injury and death of thousands of children each year. Its very widespread social acceptance means that a level of violence in childrearing is normalised, entrenching children’s low status and paving the way for other forms of violence and mistreatment.” (End Violence Against Children & End Corporal Punishment, 2022)\n\n\n“The magnitude of violence against children is staggering. Globally, the most pervasive form of violence against children is corporal punishment. Because it often occurs in the confines of homes and other settings where children live, study and play, it is largely hidden and challenging to detect. Worldwide, it is estimated that nearly one billion children are hit, slapped, spanked, pinched, or otherwise physically punished regularly by their parents, caregivers, teachers, or other trusted adults, the same individuals responsible for nurturing, protecting, and educating them (UNICEF, 2017; World Health Organization, 2020).” (Stewart-Tufescu, 2023)\n\nMore broadly, UNICEF (2024) Reports:\n\n“1.6 billion children (2 in 3) regularly face violent punishment at home; more than two thirds are subjected to both physical punishment and psychological aggression.”\n\nOur meta-analytic review of 50 years of research on the outcomes of physical punishment (Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor, 2016) demonstrated that physical punishment is associated with a wide variety of negative outcomes [learn more], and has been part of several national level policy discussions on parenting. In 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics passed a policy statement discouraging the use of physical punishment of children (Sege et al., 2019). Our meta-analysis was cited in that policy statement. Referring to our work, the policy statement indicated that “A 2016 meta-analysis showed that current literature does not support the finding of benefit from physical punishment in the long-term.” Similarly, in early 2019, the American Psychological Association also passed a resolution discouraging the use of physical punishment (American Psychological Association, 2019). This policy statement also cited our meta-analysis.\nSome research suggests that spanking should be classified as an Adverse Child Experience (Afifi et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2021; Merrick et al., 2017), and that the effects of spanking may persist well into adulthood (Afifi et al., 2017; Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor, 2016; Merrick et al., 2017). Additional quantitative work has demonstrated that the effects of spanking are evident even in contexts when physical punishment is used minimally, or when used in ostensibly “normative” ways. In a number of papers, we have investigated these associations across different communities and countries. Lastly, in additional papers, we have worked to demonstrate more “causally robust” associations between physical punishment and undesirable child outcomes using a variety of quantitative methods (e.g. Cuartas et al., 2020; Grogan-Kaylor, 2004, 2005; Ma et al., 2018; Ward et al., 2020).\nA more recent stream of research pays particular attention to parenting and child development across low and middle income countries (LMIC’s). Countries that are not high-income countries are under-represented in current social research (Henrich et al., 2010), particularly research on parenting and child development (Draper et al., 2022). We have examined the degree to which the association of particular parental discipline behaviors with child outcomes varies across a large number of countries. We have found some modest between country variation in these associations, but more importantly, have found a large degree of consistency in the degree to which parenting is associated with child outcomes across countries (Pace et al., 2019; Ward et al., 2023).\nIn this new stream of research, we examine a broader range of parenting behaviors, with a particular emphasis on “positive parenting” strategies (e.g. Ward et al., 2022, 2023). From this research, a positive discipline behavior that has emerged as being associated with better child outcomes is “explain[ing] why (child)’s behaviour was wrong.” (Ward et al., 2022, 2023)\nFurther, we are beginning to examine the association of more macro-level, or structural, factors with parenting and children’s outcomes. Most recently we have been focusing on the association of gender inequality (Ma et al., 2022; Ward et al., 2024) and political violence (Ma et al., 2025) with physical abuse, parental discipline, and child outcomes.\nI teach courses mostly in the area of statistics, quantitative methods and data visualization.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAfifi, T.

Notably, statistical programs like Stata, SAS, or SPSS all store additional information with each variable such as: a variable label, describing the contents of the variable, or the survey question that resulted in the variable; and a value label, which attaches qualitative information to each possible value of the response.\nExcel does not generally contain this extra information about each variable, or column of data, which may lead to errors in working with quantitative information.\nThe data below are stored in Stata format, but could as easily be stored in SAS or SPSS format."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For me, a recurring idea about statistical workflows is that there are certainly wrong decisions that one can make with data.\nFor example, I would not want to write the paper that says that smoking prevents lung cancer, nor would I want to write a paper saying spanking is good for children.\nThat being said, I think there are often multiple principled ways forward or multiple principled solutions.\nOften the key is not so much to make the 100% correct decision, but to make one of several possible principled decisions.\nThen after making a principled decision, one is transparent and thorough about describing the decision that one made.\n\n“In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the reality—a point well made by George Box in his oft-cited remark that ‘all models are wrong, but some are useful’ (Box, 1979 in Launer & Wilkinson (1979)).” (Hand, 2014) [emphasis added]\n\nTo propose a concrete example, to analyze clustered data, I could employ multilevel models, fixed effects regression, clustered standard errors, or generalized estimating equations. Each of these methods of analysis would carry with it different assumptions.\nTo further illustrate this point, within the domain of multilevel models, I would have further choices: I could estimate only a random intercept; estimate one or more random slopes; or estimate all possible random slopes. These random effects could be correlated or uncorrelated. I could estimate only main effects, or could estimate interactions of several variables. Each of these would be a different, yet principled, approach to analyzing the data.\nAs another example, to more robustly estimate causal effects, I could employ fixed effects, propensity scores, or cross-lagged regression models. Again, each of these methods of analysis would carry with it different assumptions, and would be a different, yet principled, approach to analyzing the data.\nIn science and statistics, we often want an answer that provides one clear direction. Instead, I’m increasingly convinced that the best science (and teaching!) often involves engaging in open discussion about the multiple possible alternatives, and then choosing one principled solution and being transparent about its implementation.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHand, D.

I’ve written up some more detailed examples of this kind of issue here and here and here.\nOne thing that I often say in teaching is that because so many of the outcomes we study are so important–and are often unequally allocated–we want to make sure our answers are as precise, and as close to correct, as we can make them. It turns out that failing to understand some of the hidden complexities of statistical thinking may lead to providing very wrong answers to important questions.\nTwo images that help me convey this idea are the Nautilus Shell, and the Mandelbrot Set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nautilus Shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of the Mandelbrot Set, produced with mandelbrot by Moore & dos Reis (2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Complex structures produced with simple rules\n\n\n\nEach of these structures is based upon simple rules that produce a complex set of outcomes (Stewart, 2017). A nautilus shell is a logarithmic spiral, a structure that depends upon maintaining a constant angle with the center as the structure expands (Livio, 2002). The Mandelbrot set is a complex pattern that emerges from some simple rules about iterating the values of a complex function (Moore & dos Reis, 2017).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLivio, M. (2002).

This is an evolving blog post on approaches to this issue.\nIn the simulated data below, there are several missing values in the first few rows of data.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Simulated Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\nz\ny\n\n\n\n\n25.5\n1\nNA\n\n\n10.3\nNA\n10.21\n\n\n10.43\n1\n8.274\n\n\n5.596\n0\n6.159\n\n\n11.53\n0\n8.09\n\n\n18.26\n1\n22.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some possible approaches that we could employ with missing data.\n\nWe could do nothing. Doing nothing would be easy. However, our sample size would be reduced because most analyses depend on complete case data. Also, missing data usually occur for a reason. Often respondents with missing data have the lowest incomes, are the most marginalized or discriminated against, and have histories with the most trauma or violence. Therefore relying on complete case analyses might introduce some amount of bias.\nWe could replace missing values with the mean. Replacing missing values with the mean would be easy. However, because respondents usually having missing data for a reason, replacing missing data with the mean would introduce bias into the data, and would also introduce false certainty into the data (p values would be artificially lowered).\nWe could use regression to impute the missing values from the complete cases. For example \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 z\\). This approach would be more difficult, but would be making use of the information in the covariates about the reasons for missing data, and would therefore reduce bias. However, by imputing a single value for each missing value, we would still be introducing false certainty into the data (p values would be artificially lowered).\nWe could perform multiple imputation. Multiple imputation would involve using regression to impute the missing values, but we would impute the missing values multiple times, each time introducing a small amount of random variation. This procedure would be more difficult–though readily available in most statistical software–and would both make use of the information in the covariates about the reasons for missing data, thus reducing bias. Further, by imputing the data multiple times, we would preserve the uncertainty around the estimates, thus making better estimates of p values."

Globally, the most pervasive form of violence against children is corporal punishment. Because it often occurs in the confines of homes and other settings where children live, study and play, it is largely hidden and challenging to detect. Worldwide, it is estimated that nearly one billion children are hit, slapped, spanked, pinched, or otherwise physically punished regularly by their parents, caregivers, teachers, or other trusted adults, the same individuals responsible for nurturing, protecting, and educating them (UNICEF, 2017; World Health Organization, 2020).” (Stewart-Tufescu, 2023)\n\nGershoff & Grogan-Kaylor (2016) reviewed 50 years of research on corporal punishment and found that:\n\n“Among the outcomes in childhood, spanking was associated with more aggression, more antisocial behavior, more externalizing problems, more internalizing problems, more mental health problems, and more negative relationships with parents. Spanking was also significantly associated with lower moral internalization, lower cognitive ability, and lower self-esteem. The largest effect size was for physical abuse; the more children are spanked, the greater the risk that they will be physically abused by their parents.” (Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor, 2016)\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGershoff, E.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was pleased to learn that I was chosen as this year’s recipient of the University of Michigan School of Social Work Doctoral Student Faculty Award.\nHere are some excerpts from the award letter:\n\n“Since 2019, DSO has created a faculty award to honor one professor that the doctoral students will collectively select for recognition. There are so many faculty members who are particularly supportive of doctoral students but may not always receive school-wide recognition. The 2019 DSO Faculty Award went to Dr. Karen Staller.”\n\n\n“It is my honor to announce that Dr. Andy Grogan-Kaylor has been chosen as this year’s recipient of the DSO Faculty Award.”\n\n\n“For years, Andy single-handedly taught the only quantitative courses available to SW Doc students. He’s super thoughtful in his approach to the course, both making it relevant and tailored to each student. He spent each and every week producing extremely high-quality material that remains a valuable resource to me years later. I am always impressed at how he scaffolds the material for those who struggle with statistics and for those who are pretty advanced. Even now, I would feel completely comfortable reaching out to Andy with any data visualization or statistical analysis questions.”\n\n\n“Andy has made a huge impact on me during my doctoral studies. I have had the pleasure of working with Andy directly and taking multiple courses from him. From both a mentorship and teaching capacity, Andy is kind, warm, and thoughtful. During his quantitative courses, Andy had a way of making us feel intelligent and valued, even when we were grappling with the difficulties of attempting to understand complex quantitative methodology. Andy would also revise and improve upon course material as a result of conversations with his students, which I felt showed his humility and respect for us. I think anyone who has taken one of Andy’s courses feels like they could email him or stumble into his office to chat anytime. He’s such a great human being, and greatly deserves this honor!”\n\n\n“Andy is well-deserving of this award. He has taught and mentored many of us doctoral students. His approach to teaching methods courses is engaging for students across a range of methodological backgrounds. His courses help us see how methods can be leveraged as a tool to advance social justice. In addition to supporting students through teaching, Andy provides a great deal of support outside the classroom. Throughout my years in the program, I have consistently noticed that doctoral students go to Andy with complex methodological questions. We always come away better equipped to move forward with our research. He has eased our anxieties through his approachability and empathy, and he has empowered us with essential knowledge and skills on our PhD journey. When I think of what kind of faculty mentor I would like to be someday, the first thing that comes to mind is ‘I want to be like Andy.’”\n\n\n“I have taken multiple statistical analysis classes throughout my academic career and yet always struggled with quantitative methods. That changed when I arrived in Prof. Grogan-Kaylor’s class. He has the unique ability of taking a complicated topic and breaking it down into a way that makes it easy to understand. He is patient and encouraging; he never makes a student feel that they are asking a dumb question. He is approachable and committed to making the skills learned in class applicable to student’s work.”\n\n\n“Prof. Grogan-Kaylor is an exceptional instructor and by far the best quantitative methods instructor I have ever had. As the sole instructor who offers doctoral-level quantitative training courses in Social Work, he is truly an asset to the school. He cares about his students, is patient, thorough (he consistently explains the intuition behind the methods in order to facilitate learning), approachable, and overall just genuinely interested in helping students reach their academic and professional potential. This award is well-deserved!”\n\n\n“Congratulations Dr. Grogan-Kaylor!”"

However, thinking through these mathematical conditions may not be helpful to develop intuitions about Simpson’s Paradox.\nCareful inspection of visualizations can help us to develop some understanding of Simpson’s Paradox.\n\nThe key substantive conclusion is that models of the data that only account for two variables may provide very different–or even opposite–conclusions about a treatment or intervention than models of the data that account for many variables."

My approach depends upon my experience working with multilevel models for about 2 decades. Yet, recently, I’ve been less and less satisfied with my recollections of which advantages of multilevel models for longitudinal data I learned about from which references. Over this break, I’ve spent some time clarifying these ideas, which you can learn about here: https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel/MLM-longitudinal-data/why-MLMs-are-good-models-for-longitudinal-data.html.\n\n\n\nA Multilevel Model For Longitudinal Data"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have been thinking a lot about the idea that Everything Is Obvious, Once You Know The Answer, as detailed in the book with this title by Duncan Watts.\nThis seems to me especially true in Social Research.\nFor example, in our work with the international MICS data, we conducted a study of the link between gender inequality and physical child abuse. We expected to find that higher levels of gender inequality led to higher levels of physical abuse for female children, but not for male children. Instead, we found that higher levels of gender inequality were associated with higher levels of physical abuse for both male and female children. Equally interesting was that we found that gender inequality was predictive of levels of child abuse, while country level GDP was not.\nSimilarly, in a study of parenting during Covid-19, we expected to find that households with children would experience higher levels of anxiety and depression than households without children. Instead, we found the opposite. Being in a household with children was generally protective for anxiety and depression.\nIn his book, Watts uses the example from over 50 years ago, of a large study conducted by Lazarsfeld of veterans returning from World War II. The results are surprising. I’ve prepared a slide deck on these ideas here: https://agrogan1.github.io/teaching/everything-is-obvious/everything-is-obvious.html#/title-slide"

    "text": "I have been thinking a lot about this wisdom from Susan Sontag, which I think has a lot of applicability to teaching, especially in teaching statistics and data analysis.\n\n“I’m often asked if there is something I think writers ought to do, and recently in an interview I heard myself say: ‘Several things. Love words, agonize over sentences. And pay attention to the world.’” (Sontag, 2007)\n\nTerminology is certainly important: for example, a regression coefficient is certainly a different quantity than its standard error, and it is important to be able to distinguish the two. At the same time, I think that in thinking and teaching about data analysis and statistics, we can lose sight of the deeper ideas in a particular equation or statistical model when we love the words too much, and focus on getting the terminology exactly right, or on parsing between roughly equivalent statistical terms. More important I think is to “agonize over the sentences” that are contained in the statistical equations that we look at so that we can engage with the deeper understandings of statistics.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nSontag, S.

However, thinking through these mathematical conditions may not be helpful to develop intuitions about Simpson’s Paradox.\nLooking at a simple visualization may help us to develop some understanding of Simpson’s Paradox.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Do We See?\nEven when presented visually, it is difficult to think through Simpson’s Paradox.\nWhat do we see?\n\nFor the sample overall, the regression line slopes downward: more treatment appears to be associated with less of the desirable outcome.\nWhen we control for group–when we start to think in multivariate terms–the individual group regression lines slope upward: more treatment appears to be associated with more of the desirable outcome.\nThus, a more complex multivariate analysis gives very different results: graphing outcomes only against treatment or intervention suggests that the treatment or intervention is harmful; graphing outcomes against treatment or intervention, but accounting for group membership, suggests that the treatment is helpful.\nThe crucial understanding is points (1)-(3) above, but why might this be? The discrepancy results from the fact that treatment provision is correlated with the outcome. Those with lower levels of the desirable outcome are getting higher levels of the treatment or intervention, a common enough situation if we think about it. This leads to the seeming paradox of finding quite different results if we only think about intervention and outcome, versus if we think about intervention, outcome, and group."

    "text": "I’ve been reflecting on the quote below. The language is unfortunately gendered, but perhaps some context is that the author was writing around 1000 AD.\n\n“Truth is sought for itself; and in seeking that which is sought for itself one is only concerned to find it… The seeker after the truth… is not he who studies the writings of the ancients and… puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. It is thus the duty of the man who studies the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency. If he follows this path, the truths will be revealed to him, and whatever shortcomings or uncertainties may exist in the discourse of those who came before him will become manifest.” (Alhazen, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAlhazen.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction 🌲\nThere is sometimes a debate–shall we say–about whether Stata can make beautiful graphs, particularly in comparison to using ggplot in R. Below, I try to use as many of Stata’s options as I can to make a beautiful graph. I believe that this Stata graph comes close to being as beautiful of a graph as would be made by ggplot (and perhaps the syntax is a little more intuitive).\nI use green and gold since they are common colors for forestry and park signage.\n\n\nData Source 🌲\nThe data used in this example are derived from the R package Functions and Datasets for “Forest Analytics with R”.\nAccording to the documentation, the source of these data are: “von Guttenberg’s Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) tree measurement data.”\n\n\n\nOld Tjikko, a 9,550 Year Old Norway Spruce in Sweden\n\n\nThe documentation goes on to further note that:\n\n“The data are measures from 107 trees. The trees were selected as being of average size from healthy and well stocked stands in the Alps.”\n\n\nuse \"https://github.com/agrogan1/multilevel/raw/master/mlm-R2-gutten/gutten.dta\", clear\n\n\n\nA Simple Graph 🌲\nThe default graphing scheme in Stata 18 is much improved over previous versions, and the below graph may be very good for many purposes.\n\nuse gutten.dta\n\ntwoway (scatter height age_base) (mspline height age_base)\n    \ngraph export gutten0.svg, width(2000) replace\n\ngraph export gutten0.png, width(2000) replace\n\n\n\n\nA Simple Graph of the Gutten Trees\n\n\n\n\nA Beautiful Graph 🌲\nBelow please find an admittedly complicated graph command. Note, however, that the graph builds upon basic ideas that we want a twoway graph, with a scatterplot and a mspline (median spline) smoother. Everything else is just an option to improve the appearance of the graph.\nI make extensive use of the /// notation which allows me to spread the graph along multiple lines.\n\nuse gutten.dta\n\ntwoway /// two way graph\n(scatter height age_base, /// scatterplot\nmcolor(dkgreen%25) msymbol(circle) msize(large)) /// dark green transparent markers\n(mspline height age_base, /// median spline \nlcolor(gold) lwidth(thick)), /// gold line\ntitle(\"Tree Height by Tree Age\") /// title\nxtitle(\"Tree Age\") /// title for x axis\nytitle(\"Tree Height\") /// title for y axis\ncaption(\"Gutten Tree Data\") /// caption\nlegend(order(1 \"trees\" 2 \"median spline\") position(6) rows(1)) /// better labels and format for legend\naspectratio(1) // better aspect ratio\n\ngraph export gutten.png, width(2000) replace\n    \ngraph export gutten.svg, width(2000) replace\n\n\n\n\nA Beautiful?

    "text": "I am the Sandra K. Danziger Collegiate Professor of Social Work.\nI am strongly motivated by concerns for human well-being. Right after undergraduate studies, I was a community organizer for a year, and then a Peace Corps Volunteer living for two years in the at-the-time remote Upper East Region of Ghana, and doing community development work, both in English, and in the local language Kusaal. These early experiences have been the source of commitments to human well-being, and to developing an evidence base for practice, that continue in my work today.\nMy core intellectual interest is the way in which parenting behaviors have an effect on child outcomes. For example, parenting behaviors like the use of corporal punishment, or parental expressions of emotional warmth, are likely to have an effect on child outcomes like aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety and depression. I am interested in how these dynamics play out across contexts, neighborhoods, and cultures.\nIn my work I use advanced statistical models, like multilevel models and some econometric models, and software like Stata, R and GIS, to examine things like growth and change over time, or community, school or parent effects on children and families. I’m also very interested in data visualization.\nI have also worked on developing and evaluating interventions for under-served populations, particularly among people who speak Spanish as their primary language.\nA lot of my work is done with international samples. The globe on this webpage indicates the countries where some of the data that I’ve used has come from, or where I have done some work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Countries where some of the data that I’ve used has come from, or where I have done some work.\n\n\n\n\nMore recently, my collaborators and I have been doing quite a bit of work with the MICS data collected by UNICEF. Below, please find a map of the countries in which the MICS surveys were conducted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Countries in MICS\n\n\n\n\nPlease click here for my faculty page on the School of Social Work website.\nFor copies of any of my published research papers, please e-mail me at agrogan@umich.edu.\nI have many course materials on the web that are not directly linked to from this website. If you are one of my students and can’t find a particular resource that you need for class, please let me know at agrogan@umich.edu.\nMy blog on statistics, data visualization, data analysis, and my research activities is at: https://agrogan1.github.io/blog.html.\nThis webpage is mostly up to date, but always under construction to some degree. If you think something should be here, but it isn’t, please let me know."

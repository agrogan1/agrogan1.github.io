    "section": "",
    "text": "I have been thinking a lot about the idea that Everything Is Obvious, Once You Know The Answer, as detailed in the book with this title by Duncan Watts.\nThis seems to me especially true in Social Research.\nFor example, in our work with the international MICS data, we conducted a study of the link between gender inequality and physical child abuse. We expected to find that higher levels of gender inequality led to higher levels of physical abuse for female children, but not for male children. Instead, we found that higher levels of gender inequality were associated with higher levels of physical abuse for both male and female children. Equally interesting was that we found that gender inequality was predictive of levels of child abuse, while country level GDP was not.\nSimilarly, in a study of parenting during Covid-19, we expected to find that households with children would experience higher levels of anxiety and depression than households without children. Instead, we found the opposite. Being in a household with children was generally protective for anxiety and depression.\nIn his book, Watts uses the example from over 50 years ago, of a large study conducted by Lazarsfeld of veterans returning from World War II. The results are surprising. I’ve prepared a slide deck on these ideas here: https://agrogan1.github.io/teaching/everything-is-obvious/everything-is-obvious.html#/title-slide"

However, Stata is often under-appreciated as data visualization software. Learning how to graph in Stata is an important part of learning how to use Stata.

In newer versions of Stata, the default graphs have been very much improved and are professional looking and aesthetically appealing out of the box. With a few tweaks, graphs in Stata can be even further customized.\nI posted a few materials on using Stata for data visualization:\n\nData Visualization With Stata [PDF]\nThe Basics of Data Visualization With Stata (PDF)"

    "text": "Introduction\nSimpson’s Paradox is the idea that associations that are found between two variables in the sample as a whole, can be very different (or even reversed) when we analyze the data by subgroups.\nThere are specific mathematical conditions under which Simpson’s Paradox applies. However, thinking through these mathematical conditions may not be helpful to develop intuitions about Simpson’s Paradox.\nLooking at a simple visualization may help us to develop some understanding of Simpson’s Paradox.\n\n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Do We See?\nEven when presented visually, it is difficult to think through Simpson’s Paradox.\nWhat do we see?\n\nFor the sample overall, the regression line slopes downward: more treatment appears to be associated with less of the desirable outcome.\nWhen we control for group–when we start to think in multivariate terms–the individual group regression lines slope upward: more treatment appears to be associated with more of the desirable outcome.\nThus, a more complex multivariate analysis gives very different results: graphing outcomes only against treatment or intervention suggests that the treatment or intervention is harmful; graphing outcomes against treatment or intervention, but accounting for group membership, suggests that the treatment is helpful.\nThe crucial understanding is points (1)-(3) above, but why might this be? The discrepancy results from the fact that treatment provision is correlated with the outcome. Those with lower levels of the desirable outcome are getting higher levels of the treatment or intervention, a common enough situation if we think about it. This leads to the seeming paradox of finding quite different results depending upon what factors we account for."

These early experiences have been the source of commitments to social justice, and to developing an evidence base for practice, that continue in my work today.\nMy core intellectual interest is the way in which parenting behaviors have an effect on child outcomes. For example, parenting behaviors like the use of corporal punishment, or parental expressions of emotional warmth, are likely to have an effect on child outcomes like aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety and depression. I am interested in how these dynamics play out across contexts, neighborhoods, and cultures.\nIn my work I use advanced statistical models, like multilevel models and some econometric models, and software like Stata, R and GIS, to examine things like growth and change over time, or community, school or parent effects on children and families. I’m also very interested in data visualization.\nI have also worked on developing and evaluating interventions for under-served populations, particularly among people who speak Spanish as their primary language.\nA lot of my work is done with international samples.

    "text": "My interests are in developing more knowledge to reduce violence against children and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), with the aim of improving child and family well-being. It is my hope that a better understanding of how to reduce violence against children, and how to reduce ACEs, will contribute to a better understanding of how to improve mental health and well-being across the lifespan. In this research I try to understand the family and community origins of aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety and depression across diverse communities and contexts. My current research focuses on parenting and child development using international data. I try to understand these issues within the context of current conversations about children’s rights.\nA particular focus of my work has been to examine the outcomes of physical punishment.\n\n“Corporal punishment is the most common form of violence against children worldwide, leading to the injury and death of thousands of children each year. Its very widespread social acceptance means that a level of violence in childrearing is normalised, entrenching children’s low status and paving the way for other forms of violence and mistreatment.” (End Violence Against Children & End Corporal Punishment, 2022)\n\n\n“The magnitude of violence against children is staggering. Globally, the most pervasive form of violence against children is corporal punishment. Because it often occurs in the confines of homes and other settings where children live, study and play, it is largely hidden and challenging to detect. Worldwide, it is estimated that nearly one billion children are hit, slapped, spanked, pinched, or otherwise physically punished regularly by their parents, caregivers, teachers, or other trusted adults, the same individuals responsible for nurturing, protecting, and educating them (UNICEF, 2017; World Health Organization, 2020).” (Stewart-Tufescu, 2023)\n\nWorking closely with many colleagues, we have shown that physical punishment is associated with a wide variety of negative outcomes. Additional quantitative work has demonstrated that this finding remains true even in contexts when physical punishment is used minimally, or when used in ostensibly “normative” ways. In a number of papers, we have investigated these associations across diverse communities and countries. Lastly, in additional papers, we have worked to demonstrate more “causally robust” associations between physical punishment and undesirable child outcomes using a variety of quantitative methods.\nA more recent stream of research examines a broader range of parenting behaviors, with particular emphasis on “positive parenting” strategies.\nI teach courses mostly in the area of statistics, quantitative methods and data visualization.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEnd Violence Against Children, & End Corporal Punishment.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was pleased to learn that I was chosen as this year’s recipient of the University of Michigan School of Social Work Doctoral Student Faculty Award.\nHere are some excerpts from the award letter:\n\n“Since 2019, DSO has created a faculty award to honor one professor that the doctoral students will collectively select for recognition. There are so many faculty members who are particularly supportive of doctoral students but may not always receive school-wide recognition. The 2019 DSO Faculty Award went to Dr. Karen Staller.”\n\n\n“It is my honor to announce that Dr. Andy Grogan-Kaylor has been chosen as this year’s recipient of the DSO Faculty Award.”\n\n\n“For years, Andy single-handedly taught the only quantitative courses available to SW Doc students. He’s super thoughtful in his approach to the course, both making it relevant and tailored to each student. He spent each and every week producing extremely high-quality material that remains a valuable resource to me years later. I am always impressed at how he scaffolds the material for those who struggle with statistics and for those who are pretty advanced. Even now, I would feel completely comfortable reaching out to Andy with any data visualization or statistical analysis questions.”\n\n\n“Andy has made a huge impact on me during my doctoral studies. I have had the pleasure of working with Andy directly and taking multiple courses from him. From both a mentorship and teaching capacity, Andy is kind, warm, and thoughtful. During his quantitative courses, Andy had a way of making us feel intelligent and valued, even when we were grappling with the difficulties of attempting to understand complex quantitative methodology. Andy would also revise and improve upon course material as a result of conversations with his students, which I felt showed his humility and respect for us. I think anyone who has taken one of Andy’s courses feels like they could email him or stumble into his office to chat anytime. He’s such a great human being, and greatly deserves this honor!”\n\n\n“Andy is well-deserving of this award. He has taught and mentored many of us doctoral students. His approach to teaching methods courses is engaging for students across a range of methodological backgrounds. His courses help us see how methods can be leveraged as a tool to advance social justice. In addition to supporting students through teaching, Andy provides a great deal of support outside the classroom. Throughout my years in the program, I have consistently noticed that doctoral students go to Andy with complex methodological questions. We always come away better equipped to move forward with our research. He has eased our anxieties through his approachability and empathy, and he has empowered us with essential knowledge and skills on our PhD journey. When I think of what kind of faculty mentor I would like to be someday, the first thing that comes to mind is ‘I want to be like Andy.’”\n\n\n“I have taken multiple statistical analysis classes throughout my academic career and yet always struggled with quantitative methods. That changed when I arrived in Prof. Grogan-Kaylor’s class. He has the unique ability of taking a complicated topic and breaking it down into a way that makes it easy to understand. He is patient and encouraging; he never makes a student feel that they are asking a dumb question. He is approachable and committed to making the skills learned in class applicable to student’s work.”\n\n\n“Prof. Grogan-Kaylor is an exceptional instructor and by far the best quantitative methods instructor I have ever had. As the sole instructor who offers doctoral-level quantitative training courses in Social Work, he is truly an asset to the school. He cares about his students, is patient, thorough (he consistently explains the intuition behind the methods in order to facilitate learning), approachable, and overall just genuinely interested in helping students reach their academic and professional potential. This award is well-deserved!”\n\n\n“Congratulations Dr. Grogan-Kaylor!”"

Spanking has indicated a similar association with health outcomes, but to date has not been considered an ACE. Physical and emotional abuse have been shown in previous research to correlate highly and may be similar in nature to spanking. To determine if spanking should be considered an ACE, this study aimed to examine 1): the grouping of spanking with physical and emotional abuse; and 2) if spanking has similar associations with poor adult health problems and accounts for additional model variance. Adult mental health problems included depressive affect, suicide attempts, moderate to heavy drinking, and street drug use.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Liberation Social Psychology: Learning From Latin America Psychology of liberation: Learning from Latin America;,citation_abstract=Liberation Social Psychology (la psicologia social de la liberacion, LSP) has developed amongst a body of psychologists in Latin America over the last decade. There has been no survey of the field in English, although some of the ideas are of relevance for those working with oppressed groups elsewhere in the world. This article explores the context in which LSP grew from the work of Ignacio Martin-Baro and was developed by Maritza Montero, amongst others. Within LSP, key concepts emerge, including ’conscientization’, ’realismo-critico’, ’de-ideologization’, a social orientation, ’the preferential option for the oppressed majorities’ and methodological eclecticism. The application of LSP is explored with reference to three domains. First, it is suggested that community social psychology as practised in some parts of Latin America reflects LSP in its emphasis on social transformation and participatory methods. Second, psycho-social work with victims of state oppression, which adopts a highly social and societal orientation embodies LSP. Third, social analyses which explicitly adopt socio-psychological-political analyses of the social realities confronting countries in Latin America embrace, in different ways, principles and concepts of LSE Some of the challenges facing LSP are discussed and open dialogue is encouraged between LSP and critical, community and applied social psychologists.

Across approaches, physical punishment at ages 9-26 months predicted reductions in children’s cognitive development of 0.08-0.21 SD at ages 27-46 months.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Poverty, by America;,citation_abstract=The Pulitzer Prize-winning, bestselling author of Evicted reimagines the debate on poverty, making a new and bracing argument about why it persists in America: because the rest of us benefit from it. The United States, the richest country on earth, has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. Why? Why does this land of plenty allow one in every eight of its children to go without basic necessities, permit scores of its citizens to live and die on the streets, and authorize its corporations to pay poverty wages? In this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are made small so that others may grow. Elegantly written and fiercely argued, this compassionate book gives us new ways of thinking about a morally urgent problem. It also helps us imagine solutions. Desmond builds a startlingly original and ambitious case for ending poverty. He calls on us all to become poverty abolitionists, engaged in a politics of collective belonging to usher in a new age of shared prosperity and, at last, true freedom&amp;amp;amp;quot;– Provided by publisher.;,citation_author=Matthew Desmond;,citation_publication_date=2023;,citation_cover_date=2023;,citation_year=2023;,citation_isbn=9780593239919;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Publishing child development research from around the world: An unfair playing field resulting in most of the world’s child population under-represented in research;,citation_abstract=Abstract It has become increasingly apparent that publishing research on child development from certain countries is especially challenging. These countries have been referred to collectively as the Majority World, the Global South, non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic), or low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this paper is to draw attention to these persistent challenges, and provide constructive recommendations to contribute to better representation of children from these countries in child development research. In this paper, we outline the history of publication bias in developmental science, and issues of generalization of research from these countries and hence where it ?fits? in terms of publishing. The importance of explaining context is highlighted, including for research on measurement child development outcomes, and attention is drawn to the vicious publication-funding cycle that further exacerbates the challenges of publishing this research. Specific recommendations are made to assist child development journals achieve their stated goals of creating a more inclusive, equitable, diverse, and global field of child development.;,citation_author=Catherine E Draper;,citation_author=Lisa M Barnett;,citation_author=Caylee J Cook;,citation_author=Jorge A Cuartas;,citation_author=Steven J Howard;,citation_author=Dana C McCoy;,citation_author=Rebecca Merkley;,citation_author=Andres Molano;,citation_author=Carolina Maldonado-Carreño;,citation_author=Jelena Obradovic;,citation_author=Gaia Scerif;,citation_author=Nadia C Valentini;,citation_author=Fotini Venetsanou;,citation_author=Aisha K Yousafzai;,citation_publication_date=2022-10;,citation_cover_date=2022-10;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1002/icd.2375;,citation_doi=10.1002/icd.2375;,citation_issn=1522-7227;,citation_volume=n/a;,citation_journal_title=Infant and Child Development;,citation_publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons, Ltd;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=In defence of the word;,citation_abstract=During long sleepless nights and days of depression, a fly buzzes and buzzes around the head:’ Writing, is it worth it?’In the midst of the farewells and the crimes, will words survive?Does this profession, which one has chosen or which has been chosen for one, make any sense?I am South American. In Montevideo, where I was born, I edited some newspapers and journals; one after the other they were closed down, by the government or by the creditors. I wrote several books: they are all banned. At the beginning of ?73, my exile began. In Buenos Aires, we founded Crisis. It was a cultural journal with the biggest circulation in the history of the Spanish language. In August of last year its last number appeared. It could not continue. When words can be no worthier than silence, it is better to say nothing. And to hope.Where are the writers and journalists who produced the journal? Almost all have left Argentina, Some are dead. Others, imprisoned or disappeared.The novelist Haroldo Conti, or what remained of him, was seen for the last time in the middle of May 1976. Broken by torture. Nothing more has been heard of him. Officially, he was not detained. The government washes its hands. The poet Miguel Angel Bustos was taken from his home and has disappeared. The poet Paco Urondo was killed in Mendoza. The writers Paoletti and Di Benedetto are in prison: As is Luis Sabini, the journal’s head of production: he is accused of possessing arms because he had a bullet to make himself a key ring. Our editor, Carlos Villar Arauja, was the first to go. In July 1975 he had to leave the country. He had published a courageous work, with documentary evidence, on oil in Argentina. That edition of Crisis was put on sale in the kiosks and, six evenings later, Carlos did not come home to sleep. They interrogated him with his eyes covered. The police denied holding him. Two days later he was flung, by a miracle still alive, into the woods of Ezeiza. The police said they had arrested him by mistake. They circulated lists of those condemned to death. The poet, Juan Gelman, editor in chief, had to take a plane. Some time later, they came looking for him in his home in Buenos Aires. As he was not there, they took his children away. The daughter turned up alive. Of the son and daughter-in-law, seven months pregnant, nothing is known. Unofficial government information indicated that they had been in prison and had been set free. The earth has swallowed them up.In such stormy times, the profession of writing is dangerous.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rich state, poor state, red state, blue state: What’s the matter with Connecticut?;,citation_abstract=For decades, the Democrats have been viewed as the party of the poor, with the Republicans representing the rich. Recent presidential elections, however, have shown a reverse pattern, with Democrats performing well in the richer blue states in the northeast and coasts, and Republicans dominating in the red states in the middle of the country and the south. Through multilevel modeling of individual-level survey data and county-and state-level demographic and electoral data, we reconcile these patterns. Furthermore, we find that income matters more in red America than in blue America. In poor states, rich people are much more likely than poor people to vote for the Republican presidential candidate, but in rich states (such as Connecticut), income has a very low correlation with vote preference.;,citation_author=Andrew Gelman;,citation_author=Boris Shor;,citation_author=Joseph Bafumi;,citation_author=David Park;,citation_publication_date=2007-11;,citation_cover_date=2007-11;,citation_year=2007;,citation_doi=10.2139/ssrn.1010426;,citation_volume=2;,citation_journal_title=Quarterly Journal of Political Science;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The weirdest people in the world?;,citation_abstract=Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world’s top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers - often implicitly - assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species - frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior - hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re‐organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.;,citation_author=Joseph Henrich;,citation_author=Steven J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender inequality in low- and middle-income countries: Associations with parental physical abuse and moderation by child gender;,citation_abstract=Gender inequality perpetuates women’s economic insecurity and a culture of violence. Parental distress caused by economic pressure may increase violence against children. High levels of gender inequality and interpersonal violence may contribute to higher levels of physical abuse. Using an ecological perspective, this study examines the association of country-level gender inequality and household-level parental physical abuse, and the moderating role of child gender in this association in low- and middle-income countries. We used data on over 420,000 households from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and country-level indicators from the United Nations Development Program Human Development data. We employed multilevel logistic regression to examine the association between gender inequality with the log-odds of physical abuse after accounting for country- and individual-level covariates. In order to more fully explore our results, we calculated predicted probabilities of abuse for several scenarios. The results indicated that higher levels of gender inequality were associated with higher probabilities of physical abuse. This association was stronger for female children than for male children. The probabilities of abuse by child gender were indistinguishable, although rates of physical abuse converged as gender inequality increased, at a statistically marginal level. These findings indicate that macro-level interventions that reduce gender inequality are necessary to prevent and reduce child physical abuse.;,citation_author=Julie Ma;,citation_author=Andrew C Grogan-Kaylor;,citation_author=Shawna J Lee;,citation_author=Kaitlin P Ward;,citation_author=Garrett T Pace;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/19/11928;,citation_doi=10.3390/ijerph191911928;,citation_issn=1660-4601;,citation_volume=19;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;">

Analysis was based on 2,472 children and their mothers who participated in Wave 3 (2001–2003; child age 3) and Wave 4 (2003–2006; child age 5) of the FFCWS. Results indicated that higher rates of neighborhood crime and violence predicted higher levels of child aggression. Maternal spanking in the past year, whether frequent or infrequent, was also associated with increases in aggressive behavior. This study contributes statistically rigorous evidence that exposure to violence in the neighborhood as well as the family context are predictors of child aggression.

The current study analyzes the relationship between an expanded ACE score that includes being spanked as a child and adult mental health outcomes by examining each ACE separately to determine the contribution of each ACE. Data were drawn from Wave II of the CDC-Kaiser ACE Study, consisting of 7465 adult members of Kaiser Permanente in southern California. Dichotomous variables corresponding to each of the 11 ACE categories were created, with ACE score ranging from 0 to 11 corresponding to the total number of ACEs experienced. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used to examine the relationship between ACEs and adult mental health outcomes adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Results indicated a graded dose-response relationship between the expanded ACE score and the likelihood of moderate to heavy drinking, drug use, depressed affect, and suicide attempts in adulthood. In the adjusted models, being spanked as a child was significantly associated with all self-reported mental health outcomes. Over 80;,citation_author=Melissa T. Merrick;,citation_author=Katie A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Attachment style and the association of spanking and child externalizing behavior;,citation_abstract=Objective: To examine whether the longitudinal associations between maternal spanking and child externalizing behavior are moderated by attachment style. Methods: This study used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 2211), a large cohort sample of low-income urban families. Multiple-group autoregressive cross-lagged models examined the associations between maternal spanking and child externalizing behavior when children were ages 1, 3, and 5. Moderation by attachment style was examined using structural invariance testing. Results: For children with an insecure mother-child attachment style, spanking at age 1 was associated with externalizing behavior at age 3. However, for children with a secure mother-child attachment style, the association between maternal spanking at age 1 and child externalizing behavior at age 3 was absent. Attachment style did not moderate the association between maternal spanking at age 3 and externalizing behavior at age 5, suggesting that spanking at age 3 is associated with deleterious outcomes at age 5, regardless of attachment style. Conclusions: Results suggest that even in the context of a secure attachment style, spanking is associated with adverse outcomes in early childhood. Findings support the American Academy of Pediatrics 2018 policy statement, which encourages parents to avoid spanking when disciplining children. Results suggest that children, regardless of attachment style, may benefit from policies and services that promote non-violent forms of discipline.;,citation_author=Kaitlin P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Quantitative literacy for social justice;,citation_abstract=In this article, we argue that many adults lack the ?numeracy? needed to function in a maximally effective manner in their vocational, civic, and personal lives. We believe schools need to foster skills in quantitative literacy (QL), an inclination and ability to make reasoned decisions using general world knowledge and fundamental mathematics in authentic everyday circumstances. We explain how schools might begin to make inroads in preparing more quantitatively literate students and how this goal coincides with efforts toward greater social justice.;,citation_author=Lynda R Wiest;,citation_author=Heidi J Higgins;,citation_author=Janet Hart Frost;,citation_publication_date=2007-04;,citation_cover_date=2007-04;,citation_year=2007;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10665680601079894;,citation_doi=10.1080/10665680601079894;,citation_issn=1066-5684;,citation_volume=40;,citation_journal_title=Equity &amp;amp;amp; Excellence in Education;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I’ve heard somewhere–I unfortunately forget exactly where–that a statistical model is nothing more than a principled statement about the data, that can be tested against the data. I think of moderation in that context.</p>
<p>Moderation is a kind of “statistical story” about different groups in the data.</p>
<p>As we build up to the idea of moderation, we are telling various “stories” about the data, and testing whether they are accurate.</p>

<p>If we consider a group membership variable that has values <em>0</em> or <em>1</em>, then effectively, the <em>intercept</em> for <em>group 0</em> is <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and the <em>slope</em> for <em>group 0</em> is <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>. For <em>group 1</em>, the <em>intercept</em> is <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 + \beta_2\)</span> while the <em>slope</em> is <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 + \beta_3\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> is thus the <em>difference in intercepts</em> between the two groups.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span> is the <em>difference in slopes</em> between the two groups.</p>

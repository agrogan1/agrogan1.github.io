Iâ€™d like to share that my book, *Multilevel Thinking: Discovering Variation, Universals, and Particulars in Cross-Cultural Research* has been [published electronically](https://academic.oup.com/book/60530) at Oxford University Press. [Electronic and print copies](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/iYUI0QEACAAJ?hl=en) are also available through Google Books.

* This book explains multilevel modeling building upon my 15 years of teaching this topic.
* I argue that multilevel modeling is a principled way of thinking about human variation and universals. 
* The book contains appendices for estimating multilevel models in Stata, R, and Julia.

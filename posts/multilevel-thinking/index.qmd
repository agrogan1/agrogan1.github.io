Iâ€™d like to share that my book, *Multilevel Thinking: Discovering Variation, Universals, and Particulars in Cross-Cultural Research* is [available for pre-order](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/multilevel-thinking-9780197806463?cc=us&lang=en&# ) at Oxford University Press

* This book explains multilevel modeling building upon my 15 years of teaching this topic.
* I argue that multilevel modeling is a principled way of thinking about human variation and universals. 
* The book contains appendices for estimating multilevel models in Stata, R, and Julia.

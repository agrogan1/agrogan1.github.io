We've published a new paper on empathy and mental health outcomes [@empathy]. The paper uses generalized additive models [@Wood2017; @Wood2025] to examine non-linear relationships between empathy and self-harm, and provides evidence that empathy may be a "risky strength". Too much or too little empathy is associated with higher levels of self-harm thoughts, while a moderate amount of empathy is associated with lower levels of self-harm thoughts.

A *scrollytelling* summary of the paper is available here:  [https://agrogan1.github.io/closeread/empathy/empathy.html](https://agrogan1.github.io/closeread/empathy/empathy.html)

I've made updates to *Two Page Stata*: [https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/two-page-stata/TwoPageStata.pdf](https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/two-page-stata/TwoPageStata.pdf) [[HTML](https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/two-page-stata/TwoPageStata.html)].

*Two Page Stata* is intended to be an introduction to Stata in 2 pages. The treatment here is intended to be extremely brief, in order to create a kind of "cheat sheet" that can be presented in 2 pages.

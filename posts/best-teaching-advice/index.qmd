The best teaching advice that I ever received was at a new faculty workshop, at my first academic job, at the University of Kentucky. The Professor giving the advice, who I believe was an Astronomy Professor, said that the most important rules of teaching were: 

1. Care about your material. Believe that it is important.
2. Care about your students. Respect your students.
3. Work hard.

The Professor said if you follow these 3 rules, you can make many mistakes in teaching--as indeed I have--and your teaching and your evaluations will still turn out alright. You can try many experiments, some of which will flop, but as long as you are following these three rules, your students will see that, and things will turn out OK.

On the other hand, if you show that you don't care about your material, don't care about your students, or aren't working hard, your students will also see that, and your teaching will not be well received, no matter what other "tricks of the trade" you employ.

After more than 20 years of teaching, I continue to believe that the essence of good teaching is caring about your material; caring about your students, and working hard.

I've developed two new handouts on making tables in Stata with the older `estimates table` and the newer `etable` command.

* The [longer more complicated handout using both `estimates table` and `etable`](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel/tables/tables.html). 
* A [shorter working example using `etable`](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel/tables/tables2.html) 

::: {.callout-tip}
Both handouts are provided for the sake of completeness, but the second handout using `etable` is more straightforward and clear ðŸ˜ƒ.

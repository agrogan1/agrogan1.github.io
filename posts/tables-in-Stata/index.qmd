I've developed two new handouts on making tables in Stata with the older `estimates table` and the newer `etable` command.

* The [longer more complicated handout](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel/tables/tables.html). 
* A [shorter working example](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel/tables/tables2.html) ðŸ˜ƒ.

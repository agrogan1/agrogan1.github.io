A *treemap* is a visualization of the data where the area of polygons are sized by some feature of the data.

I've developed the *treemap* below to demonstrate that the majority of the world's children are not protected by bans on corporal punishment.

```{r}
#| output: false

# list.files("../../../cpbans")

file.copy("../../../cpbans/treemap.png",
          ".")

```

# Introduction ðŸŒ²

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
 
library(Statamarkdown)

```


There is sometimes a *debate*--shall we say--about whether Stata can make beautiful graphs, particularly in comparison to using `ggplot` in R. Below, I try to use as many of Stata's options as I can to make a beautiful graph. I believe that this Stata graph comes close to being as beautiful of a graph as would be made by `ggplot`.

I use green and gold since they are common colors for forestry and park signage.

# Data Source ðŸŒ²

The data used in this example are derived from the R package *Functions and Datasets for "Forest Analytics with R"*.

According to the documentation, the source of these data are: "von Guttenbergâ€™s Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) tree measurement data."

The documentation goes on to further note that:

> "The data are measures from 107 trees. The trees were selected as being of average size from healthy and well stocked stands in the Alps."

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}
#| echo: true

use "https://github.com/agrogan1/multilevel/raw/master/mlm-R2-gutten/gutten.dta", clear

```

# A Simple Graph ðŸŒ²

The default graphing scheme in Stata 18 is much improved over previous versions, and the below graph may be very good for many purposes.

```{stata}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

use gutten.dta

twoway (scatter height age_base) (lowess height age_base)
	
graph export gutten0.svg, width(2000) replace

graph export gutten0.png, width(2000) replace

```

# A Beautiful Graph ðŸŒ²

Below please find an *admittedly complicated* graph command. Note, however, that the graph builds upon basic ideas that we want a `twoway` graph, with a `scatter`plot and a `lowess` smoother. Everything else is just an option to improve the appearance of the graph.

I make extensive use of the `///` notation which allows me to spread the graph along multiple lines.

```{stata}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

use gutten.dta

twoway /// two way graph
(scatter height age_base, /// scatterplot
mcolor(dkgreen%25) msymbol(circle) msize(large)) /// dark green transparent markers
(mspline height age_base, /// median spline 
lcolor(gold) lwidth(thick)), /// gold line
title("Tree Height by Tree Age") /// title
xtitle("Tree Age") /// title for x axis
ytitle("Tree Height") /// title for y axis
caption("Gutten Tree Data") /// caption
legend(order(1 "trees" 2 "median spline") position(6) rows(1)) /// better labels and format for legend
aspectratio(.5) // better aspect ratio

graph export gutten.png, width(2000) replace
	
graph export gutten.svg, width(2000) replace

```

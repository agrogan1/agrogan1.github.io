I've been making updates to my *Very Short Introduction to Stata*: [https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/very-short-introduction/very-short-introduction.html](https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/very-short-introduction/very-short-introduction.html).

One of the things I especially like about this *Very Short Introduction* is that it shows me--and hopefully helps me to show my students--the simple intuitive syntax of Stata that is incredibly consistent across a wide variety of statistical models and tasks: `command variables, options`.

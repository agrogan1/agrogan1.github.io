Logic models are used extensively in program development and program evaluation. I have worked on a logic model in [`graphviz`](../logic-models/). Here is an implementation using the `mermaid` graphing language.

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: true
%%| code-fold: true

flowchart LR
    subgraph Domains
    direction TB
    D1(Workshops)
    D2(Publications)
    end
    subgraph Activities
    direction TB
    A1(Meetings)
    A2(Social Media Posts)
    A3(Information Cards)
    end
    subgraph Outcomes
    direction TB
    O1(Better Parenting)
    end
    D1-->A1
    D2-->A2
    D2-->A3
    A1-->O1
    A2-->O1
    A3-->O1
    
```

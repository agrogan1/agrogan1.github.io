Logic models are used extensively in program development and program evaluation. I have worked on a logic model in [`graphviz`](../logic-models/). Here is an implementation using the `mermaid` graphing language.

While still sometimes not completely intuitive, I think that the language of `mermaid` is more intuitive than [my `graphviz` example](https://agrogan1.github.io/teaching/logic-models/logic-models.html).

`mermaid` is implemented in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). This logic model was made with RStudio.

This proof of concept makes use of *subgraphs* to organize the components of a logic model.

Like all programming languages, `mermaid` may facilitate automation, replication, and documentation of a project. In this way, using `mermaid` may make creating a logic model easier.

Like all programming languages, `mermaid` may be finicky and hard to tweak. In this way, using `mermaid` may make creating a logic model much more difficult. 

**It may be much easier to use PowerPoint or Google Slides to create a logic model!!!**

George Box famously said:

Drawing upon this idea, about a year ago, I developed a tutorial to explore the idea of how quantitative methods can allow one to *be less wrong* about important social issues:  [https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/be-less-wrong/](https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/be-less-wrong/).

Since that time, I've made some updates: minor updates to the diagrams; and some notes clarifying the relationship of the ideas in the tutorial to ideas about RCT's, statistical mediation, statistical confounders, and statistical colliders.

George Box famously said:

Drawing upon this idea, I have developed a page to explore the idea of how quantitative methods can allow one to *be less wrong* about important social issues:  [https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/be-less-wrong/](https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/be-less-wrong/).

The page uses ideas of *scrollytelling* to explain these ideas. [`closeread`](https://closeread.dev/) is a new extension for [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) that allows one to present stories using *scrollytelling.*

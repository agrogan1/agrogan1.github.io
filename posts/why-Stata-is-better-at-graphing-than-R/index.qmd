# Introduction

Both R and Stata are programs with strong data visualization and analysis capabilities. However, Stata's capabilities as a data visualization program are sometimes under-rated. The intent of the post is to show that Stata can often perform the same graphing task as R, with much simpler, and much more intuitive, command syntax.

This post uses simulated social service agency data clients. In each program, I am going to graph mental health of clients (at Time 2) by program.

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(Statamarkdown)

```

# Stata

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}
#| output: false

import delimited "clients.csv", clear // import data
	
graph bar mental_health_t2, /// bar graph of mean outcome
over(program) /// over program
asyvars // bars that have color

```

```{stata}
#| output: false
#| echo: false

quietly graph export mybarStata.png, width(2000) replace


```

# R

```{r}

library(readr) # library to import data
	
clients <- read_csv("clients.csv") # import data
	
library(ggplot2) # library for graphs
	
ggplot(clients, # the data that I am using
       aes(x = program, # 'aesthetic' includes x
           y = mental_health_T2, # and y
           fill = program)) + # and fill by program
  stat_summary(fun = mean, # summarizing y 
               geom = "bar") + # with bars
  theme_minimal() # minimal theme

```

[`closeread`](https://closeread.dev/) is a new extension for [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) that allows one to present stories using *scrollytelling.*

I have developed a *scrollytelling* page to present the results of [@Ward2023]:  [https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/parenting/](https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/parenting/).

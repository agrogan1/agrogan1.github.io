Scientific and quantitative thinking are sometimes construed as a *Western*, or even *colonial* activities. In contrast, I believe and argue that science and quantitative thinking are ways of thinking that are useful for all of us, whenever we encounter the material world, particularly when we desire to confront or address inequities or challenges of that material world. In this light, science and quantitative reasoning might be seen as pan-human cross-cultural activities, allowing human beings to fruitfully engage the material world. In a set of rich descriptions, @Sagan1995 describes the thinking of the !Kung San, who use detailed careful and repeated observation of the natural world to construct empirical knowledge that allows them to navigate and survive in the harsh environment of the Kalahari desert. Far from being the domain exclusively of one group of people, @Sagan1995 argues that science is a quintessentially human activity[^ethics].

[^ethics]: I'm certainly aware that science--like *any* domain of human thinking--can be misused, and has been misused. The only way to prevent this, I believe, is to couple scientific thinking with rigorous moral reasoning. But that is a subject for a different book!

Similarly, the Islamic scientist @Alhazen_2023, often seen as one of the first exponents of scientific, thinking, describes the scientific method in a text from 1000 A.D. The language is unfortunately gendered, which can perhaps be understood given the era of the writing.

> "The seeker after the truth... is not he who studies the writings of the ancients and... puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency." [@Alhazen_2023]

Another quote that has recently struck me from the wonderful essay / poem by Julia Schanen [@Schanen2021]:

> "I’m getting tired of being mistaken for a genius,
>
> when I’m just a plain old nerd.
>
> Struggling, stumbling, pushing, experimenting.
>
> Trying to get more of something that makes me feel
>
> fascinated and uncomfortable,
>
> hopeless,
>
> stupid,
>
> excited,
>
> real." [@Schanen2021]

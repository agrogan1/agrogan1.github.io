As a teacher, with some frequency, I hear the idea from students that when statistically significant *interaction terms* are present, one does not need to interpret main effects at all, a contention apparently heard by others [@GraceMartin], yet which to me appears mathematically and statistically unfounded.

I'm thankful to a StataList post by @Kolev2022 for providing a mathematical foundation to this thinking. 

Consider the following equation with an interaction term:  

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 m + \beta_3 xm + e_i$$ {#eq-moderation}

@Kolev2022 uses derivatives to make a point. I'm going to use partial derivatives, because I think they are more accurate.

$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \beta_1 + \beta_3 m$$ {#eq-moderation}

So, using the partial derivative of y with respect to x, we see that this partial derivative depends both upon the main effect of x, $\beta_1$, and the effect of $m$, $\beta_3 m$.

That main effect, $\beta_1$, might be 0, but even then, it needs to be interpreted. 

Interactions and main effects need to be interpreted together.

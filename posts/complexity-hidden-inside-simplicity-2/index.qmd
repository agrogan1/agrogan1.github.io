## Complex Answers Hidden Inside Simple Questions

My history of teaching statistical methods has over time convinced me that statistical questions are often seemingly simple questions, that contain complex answers, or answers that have complex operationalizations.

One thing that I often say in teaching is that because so many of the outcomes we study are so important–and are often so unequally allocated–we want to make sure our answers are as precise, and as close to correct, as we can make them. As I detail elsewhere in this book, it turns out that failing to understand some of the hidden complexities of statistical thinking may lead to providing very wrong answers to important questions.

Two images that I carry with me, and that help me convey this idea are the Nautilus Shell, and the Mandelbrot Set.

Complex structures produced with simple rules

Each of these images derive from a simple set of rules that produces complex outcomes, thus seeming somewhat analagous to the process of learning statistics. The nautilus shell is based upon a logistic spiral, a spiral that as it grows outward maintains a constant angle with the center [@Livio2002]. The Mandelbrot set is created by a simple set of iterations through a function of complex numbers that ends up generating extremely complex outcomes [@Mandelbrot].

In the approach that I am taking in this book, I believe that there are definite *realities* of suffering, exploitation, violence, discrimination, and other associated problems that we are trying to understand. 

> "What we see and how we see is of course determined by our perspective, by the place from which we begin our examination of history; but it is determined also by reality itself." [@Martin-Baro1994B]

We hope that our understandings will inform efforts for social change. Yet, at the same time we must recognize that our understandings are at best *iterative* and *contingent.* While we will never have a perfect understanding of social reality, we can always improve our understandings, and move in the direction of being *less wrong*.

As @Silverman1998 wrote: 

> "... there is no way to know when our observations about complex events in nature are complete. Our knowledge is finite, Karl Popper emphasised, but our ignorance is infinite. ... [W]e can never be certain about the consequences of our interventions, we can only narrow the area of uncertainty. This admission is not as pessimistic as it sounds: claims that resist repeated energetic challenges often turn out to be quite reliable. Such 'working truths' are the building blocks for the reasonably solid structures that support our everyday actions..." [@Silverman1998]

This recalls the famous saying by the statistician George Box about statistical models, reported in many places, and well captured in the passage below by @Hand2014:

> "In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the realityâ€”a point well made by George Box in his oft-cited remark that 'all models are wrong, but some are useful' (Box, 1979 in @MR0554183)." [@Hand2014]

A key task then, of using advanced quantitative methods such as multilevel modeling is to use them to try to be progressively *less wrong* about the answers we are finding to important questions about improving human wellbeing. 

To reiterate a point made earlier in this chapter, there are many potential complications in data analysis. Omitted variables are an issue that trouble all quantitative research. Multilevel data provides additional complications in that statistical significance (p values) becomes more difficult to estimate correctly (making false positives more likely), and without use of appropriate methods, the signs and magnitudes of regression coefficients ($\beta$'s) may be wrong. 

Correct application of multilevel models can help us to be *less wrong* about all of these issues, and to come closer to providing helpful answers to the people we are working with.

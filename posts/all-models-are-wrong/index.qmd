I believe that there are definite *realities* of suffering, exploitation, violence, discrimination, and other associated problems that we are trying to understand. 

> "What we see and how we see is of course determined by our perspective, by the place from which we begin our examination of history; but it is determined also by reality itself." [@Martin-Baro1994B]

We hope that our understandings will inform efforts for social change. Yet, at the same time we must recognize that our understandings are at best *iterative* and *contingent.* While we will never have a perfect understanding of social reality, we can always improve our understandings, and move in the direction of being *less wrong*.

As @Silverman1998 wrote: 

> "... there is no way to know when our observations about complex events in nature are complete. Our knowledge is finite, Karl Popper emphasised, but our ignorance is infinite. ... [W]e can never be certain about the consequences of our interventions, we can only narrow the area of uncertainty. This admission is not as pessimistic as it sounds: claims that resist repeated energetic challenges often turn out to be quite reliable. Such 'working truths' are the building blocks for the reasonably solid structures that support our everyday actions..." [@Silverman1998]

This recalls the famous saying by the statistician George Box about statistical models, reported in many places, and well captured in the passage below by @Hand2014:

> "In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the realityâ€”a point well made by George Box in his oft-cited remark that 'all models are wrong, but some are useful' (Box, 1979 in @MR0554183)." [@Hand2014]

A key task then, of using advanced quantitative methods is to use them to try to be progressively *less wrong* about the answers we are finding to important questions about improving human wellbeing. 

There are many potential complications in data analysis. 

Omitted variables are an issue that trouble all quantitative research. 

*Simpson's Paradox* [@Simpson1951] wherein omission of a relevant *covariate* (e.g. $z_{it}$ such as SES, community characteristics, country level characteristics) may also lead to dramatically incorrect results. The issue of omitted variables is a crucially important--and sometimes underappreciated--issue that pervades all statistical work.

Statistically, we imagine a situation where the true model is:

$$\text{child outcome}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{parenting}_{it} +$$ 

$$\beta_2 \text{individual or family or community or country characteristic}_{it} + $$
$$u_{0i} + e_{it}$$

If *individual or family or community or country characteristics* in fact influence *outcome*, but are not included in the statistical model, perhaps because they are not measured in the data, then the estimate of $\beta_1$ for *parenting* will be biased. See @fig-Simpson for an illustration. 

```{r}

library(haven)

multilevelstructure <- read_dta("multilevelstructure.dta")

multilevelstructure$country <- factor(multilevelstructure$country)

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-Simpson

#| message: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(multilevelstructure, 
             aes(x = x,
                 y = y)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_point(aes(color = country)) + # points with country color
  geom_smooth(aes(color = country), # smoothers with country color
              method = "lm") + 
  labs(title = "Desirable Outcome as a Function of Parenting",
       x = "intervention or treatment or parenting (x)",
       y = "desirable outcome (y)",
       caption = "Slope not accounting for covariate(s) slopes downward. \nSlope accounting for covariate(s) slopes upward.") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = "covariate (z)") +
  theme_minimal() 


```

When possible confounders are *measured*, we can include those variables in the statistical model. When possible confounders are *unmeasured*, we need to try to use methods that capture those *unmeasured* confounders.

In the approach that I am taking in this book, I believe that there are definitely *realities* of suffering, exploitation, violence, discrimination, and other associated problems that we are trying to understand. We hope that our understandings will inform efforts for social change. Yet, at the same time we must recognize that our understandings are at best *iterative* and *contingent.* While we will never have a perfect understanding of social reality, we can always improve our understandings, and move in the direction of being *less wrong*.

As @Silverman1998 wrote: 

> "... there is no way to know when our observations about complex events in nature are complete. Our knowledge is finite, Karl Popper emphasised, but our ignorance is infinite. ... [W]e can never be certain about the consequences of our interventions, we can only narrow the area of uncertainty. This admission is not as pessimistic as it sounds: claims that resist repeated energetic challenges often turn out to be quite reliable. Such 'working truths' are the building blocks for the reasonably solid structures that support our everyday actions..." [@Silverman1998]

This echoes the famous saying by the statistician George Box about statistical models, reported in many places, and well captured in the passage below by @Hand2014:

> "In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the realityâ€”a point well made by George Box in his oft-cited remark that 'all models are wrong, but some are useful' (Box, 1979 in @MR0554183)."

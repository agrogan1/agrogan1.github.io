I have developed a book draft on multilevel modeling, entitled [*Multilevel Thinking*](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/). The book draft discusses multilevel modeling in the context of cross cultural, or international, research. 

The book draft is being updated to reflect the perspective of visualizing multilevel models using multiple statistical languages: Stata, R, and Julia. This developing tutorial can be found at: [https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-visualization/](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-visualization/)

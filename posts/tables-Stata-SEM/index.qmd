I have a new abbreviated handout on making tables for `sem` in Stata: [https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/tables-SEM/tables-SEM.html](https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/tables-SEM/tables-SEM.html)

Earlier, I developed [two new handouts](https://agrogan1.github.io/posts/tables-in-Stata/index.html) on making tables in Stata with a particular focus on multilevel models.

> "In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the realityâ€”a point well made by George Box in his oft-cited remark that 'all models are wrong, but some are useful' (Box, 1979 in @MR0554183)."

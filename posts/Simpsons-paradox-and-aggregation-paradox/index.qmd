I am starting to think that [Simpson's Paradox](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/longitudinal.html#simpsons-paradox) and the Aggregation Paradox (which elsewhere I term "[multilevel structure](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/cross-sectional.html#sec-multilevelstructure)"), are variations of the same phenomenon.

Consider a simple regression equation.

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{ij} + \beta_2 z_{ij} + u_{0j} + e_{ij}$$

* Simpson's Paradox could possibly occur if we omit $z_{ij}$ from the regression equation.
* The Aggregation Paradox could possibly occur if we omit $u_{0j}$ from the regression equation.

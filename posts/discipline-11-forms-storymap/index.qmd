Last year, we published an article entitled "Associations Between 11 Forms of Discipline and Child Outcomes Across 60 Countries" in *BMJ Open*:  [https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/10/e058439](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/10/e058439)

I prepared--and have just recently updated--an ArcGIS StoryMap summarizing that research--which is linked to [elsewhere on this website](../../research.qmd)--but realized that I wanted to link to it in this blog. To view, click on [this link](https://arcg.is/1OSzvG0).

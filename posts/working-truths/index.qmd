> "... there is no way to know when our observations about complex events in nature are complete. Our knowledge is finite, Karl Popper emphasised, but our ignorance is infinite. ... [W]e can never be certain about the consequences of our interventions, we can only narrow the area of uncertainty.

Such 'working truths' are the building blocks for the reasonably solid structures that support our everyday actions..." [@Silverman1998]

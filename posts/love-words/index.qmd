I have been thinking a lot about this wisdom from Susan Sontag, which I think has a lot of applicability to teaching, especially in teaching statistics and data analysis.

> "Iâ€™m often asked if there is something I think writers ought to do, and recently in an interview I heard myself say: 'Several things. Love words, agonize over sentences. And pay attention to the world.'" [@Sontag2007]

Terminology is certainly important: for example, it wouldn't make sense to refer to a *regression coefficient* as a *Hobbit*. At the same time, I think that in thinking and teaching about data analysis and statistics, we can lose sight of the deeper ideas in a particular equation or statistical model when we focus on getting the terminology *exactly* right. More important I think is to *"agonize over the sentences"* that are contained in the statistical equations that we look at.

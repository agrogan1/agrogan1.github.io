I have been thinking a lot about this wisdom from Susan Sontag, which I think has a lot of applicability to teaching, especially in teaching statistics and data analysis.

Terminology is certainly important: for example, a *regression coefficient* is certainly a different quantity than its *standard error*, and it is important to be able to distinguish the two. At the same time, I think that in thinking and teaching about data analysis and statistics, we can lose sight of the deeper ideas in a particular equation or statistical model when we *love the words too much*, and focus on getting the terminology *exactly* right, or on parsing between roughly equivalent statistical terms. More important I think is to *"agonize over the sentences"* that are contained in the statistical equations that we look at so that we can engage with the deeper understandings of statistics.

I have developed a book draft on multilevel modeling, entitled [*Multilevel Thinking*](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/). The book draft discusses multilevel modeling in the context of cross cultural, or international, research. 

The book draft is written from the perspective of using Stata. I am thinking about how to analyze multilevel models using multiple statistical languages: Stata, R, and Julia. This developing tutorial can be found at: [https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-multilingual/](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-multilingual/)

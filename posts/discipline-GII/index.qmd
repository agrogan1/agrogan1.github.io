We've just published an article entitled *Interactions Of Gender Inequality And Parental Discipline Predicting Child Aggression In Low- And Middle-Income Countries*.

Contrary to expectations from theory, we find that parenting effects are *weaker* in contexts of *higher* gender inequality, and *stronger* in contexts of *lower* gender inequality. We recommend that interventions to improve parenting and child well being need to have a *multilevel* conceptualization, and to focus on both parenting and reducing gender inequality at a country level.

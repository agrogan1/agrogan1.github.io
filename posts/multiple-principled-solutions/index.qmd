One of my most recent ideas about statistical workflows is that there are certainly *wrong* decisions that one can make with data. 

For example, I would not want to write the paper that says that smoking prevents lung cancer, nor would I want to write a paper saying spanking is good for children. 

That being said, I think there are often *multiple principled ways forward*.

Often the key is not so much to make the 100% correct decision, but to make one of *several possible principled decisions*. 

Then after making a *principled decision*, one is *transparent* and *thorough* about describing the decision that one made.

# Introduction

`merge`-ing data and `append`-ing data are often confused. In this post, I try to quickly distinguish the two.

# `merge`-ing Data Compared To `append`-ing Data

1. Visually, `merge` can be thought of as placing data sets side by side, effectively making a wider data set. 
2. Visually, `append` can be thought of as stacking data sets on top of each other, making a longer data set.
3. In both procedures, you likely want to start by `use`-ing each data set, only `keep`-ing variables of interest, and `save`-ing under a new filename.
4. In `merge`-ing you are more likely to want to ensure that variables in *different* waves will have *different* names. You may have to `rename` variables to accomplish this. 
5. When `append`-ing, you are more likely to want `rename` the variables in *different* waves of data so that they have the *same* name. Make sure each wave of data has a *time* variable for the wave before you `append`!

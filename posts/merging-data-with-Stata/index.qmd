# Introduction

Merging data is often one of the most simple seeming, but actually complicated tasks in any statistical software program.

In this post, I try to provide a brief introduction to merging data in Stata.

# Types of Merges

```{mermaid}

    subgraph datasetA
    a1
    a2
    a3
    end
    subgraph datasetB
    b1
    b2
    b3
    end
    
    a1 <--> b1
    a2 <--> b2
    a3 <--> b3
    
```

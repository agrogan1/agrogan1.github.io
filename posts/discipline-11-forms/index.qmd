Last Fall, we published an article entitled "Associations Between 11 Forms of Discipline and Child Outcomes Across 60 Countries" in *BMJ Open*:  [https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/10/e058439](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/10/e058439)

I prepared a slide deck summarizing that research--which is linked to [elsewhere on this website](../../research.qmd)--but realized that I wanted to link to it in this blog.

There are definite *realities* of suffering, exploitation, violence, discrimination, and other associated problems that we are trying to understand, and to reduce. 

> "What we see and how we see is of course determined by our perspective, by the place from which we begin our examination of history; but it is determined also by reality itself." [@Martin-Baro1994B]

We hope that our research will inform efforts to change these *realities*. Yet, at the same time we must recognize that our understandings are at best *iterative* and *contingent.* While we will never have a perfect understanding of social reality, we can always improve our understandings, and move in the direction of being *less wrong*.

As @Silverman1998 wrote: 

> "... there is no way to know when our observations about complex events in nature are complete. Our knowledge is finite, Karl Popper emphasised, but our ignorance is infinite. ... [W]e can never be certain about the consequences of our interventions, we can only narrow the area of uncertainty. This admission is not as pessimistic as it sounds: claims that resist repeated energetic challenges often turn out to be quite reliable. Such 'working truths' are the building blocks for the reasonably solid structures that support our everyday actions..." [@Silverman1998]

This recalls the famous saying by the statistician George Box about statistical models, reported in many places, and well captured in the passage below by @Hand2014:

> "In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the realityâ€”a point well made by George Box in his oft-cited remark that 'all models are wrong, but some are useful' (Box, 1979 in @MR0554183)." [@Hand2014]

A key task then, of using quantitative methods is to use them to try to be progressively *less wrong* about the answers we are finding to important questions about improving human wellbeing. 

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

```

```{r}

intervention <- seq(1,15) # intervention

group <- rep(seq(1,5), each=3) # group

index <- rep(seq(1,3), 5) # index within group

e <- rnorm(15, 0, .25) # randomly distributed error

outcome <- index + -.1 * intervention # + e

group <- factor(group)

mydata <- data.frame(intervention, group, outcome)

```

```{r}

p0 <- ggplot(mydata,
       aes(x = intervention,
           y = outcome)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5)+
  geom_smooth(method="lm",
              size = 2,
              se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = "group",
                        option = "turbo") +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}

p0 # replay

```

```{r}
p0 + aes(color = group)

```

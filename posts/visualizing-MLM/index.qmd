I have developed a book draft on multilevel modeling, entitled *Multilevel Thinking*. The book draft discusses multilevel modeling in the context of cross cultural, or international, research. 

I have been thinking more about one of the ideas in that book draft:  multilevel models as the *exploration* of human variation.

With those ideas in mind, I have developed a [tutorial on visualizing multilevel models](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel/visualizing-MLM/visualizing-MLM.html). 

I've been working on an alternative version in [Slide Show Format](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel/visualizing-MLM/visualizing-MLM-slidy.html). Use the **right arrow** and **left arrow** to scroll through the presentation. Use **b** to make text bigger, and **s** to make text smaller. Press **c** for a table of contents.

I have published a book on multilevel modeling, entitled [Multilevel Thinking](https://academic.oup.com/book/60530) at Oxford University Press. [Electronic and print copies](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/iYUI0QEACAAJ?hl=en) are also available through Google Books. 

The book discusses multilevel modeling in the context of cross cultural, or international, research. 

Writing the book prompted a lot of thinking about a key idea: multilevel models as the *exploration* of human variation.

With those ideas in mind, I have developed a [tutorial on visualizing multilevel models](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel/visualizing-MLM/visualizing-MLM.html). 

An alternative version in [Slide Show Format](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel/visualizing-MLM/visualizing-MLM-slidy.html) is also available, though less frequently updated. Use the **right arrow** and **left arrow** to scroll through the presentation. Use **b** to make text bigger, and **s** to make text smaller. Press **c** for a table of contents.

I've updated my *Michigan Colors for Stata Graphs* at:  [https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/michigan-graph-scheme/](https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/michigan-graph-scheme/).

The updated graph scheme includes the original `michigan` scheme with University of Michigan colors, but also a remixed version, `michigan2`, where blue and maize are followed by most of the cooler colors of the palette, the warmer colors of the palette, and finally *Taubman Teal*. 

```{r}

library(Statamarkdown)

```


```{stata}

clear all

quietly set obs 9

generate x = _n
	
quietly save "graphdemo.dta", replace

graph bar (count), ///

name(michigan, replace)
	
quietly graph export michigan.png, name("michigan") width(2000) replace

```
